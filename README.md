## Introduction

This repository contains a wide range of algorithms, from basic ones like sorting and searching, to more complex algorithms such as graph traversal and dynamic programming. Each algorithm is implemented with clear, concise code and is accompanied by documentation explaining how it works.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com
```

Navigate to the folder of the algorithm you’re interested in, and run the code. Most of the implementations will have an accompanying README.md file with specific instructions on how to run the code.
